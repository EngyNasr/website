We are part of the plant-based [COST action INDEPTH](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA16212/#tabs|Name:overview) and we have a big plant community using Galaxy. Recently we have installed 100 new plant reference genomes and transcriptomes. A list with the 118 newly added plant ref genomes, you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S99PugB3cel8HsVEaD0cdYddwadUq8Ry/view?usp=sharing). The reference data comes along with a annotation file (gtf), the sequences, kallisto index and salmon index.

Taken all together, Galaxy provides you now access to more than 1700 different reference genomes and we hope, we can support your work with it!
